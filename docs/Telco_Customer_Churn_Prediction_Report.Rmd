# Summary

In this project, we attempt to examine the following question: Consider certain telecommunications customer characteristics, predict the likelihood that a given customer is likely to churn, and further understand what customer characteristics are positively associated with high churn risk. We performed a analysis, which yield the 

# Introduction

Customer churn risk, the risk of customers switching to another company, is considered one of the most significant threats to the revenue of telecommunication companies. (citation) The average churn rate in the telecom industry is approximately 1.9% per month, which translates to discontinued service for one in fifty subscribers of a given company.(citation) Moreover, it is known that the cost of acquiring new customers is significantly higher than the cost of retaining them. (citation) Thus, it is clear that reducing churn risk and increasing customer retention rate is a key strategic challenge in the telecommunication industry.
In our project, we are identifying a predictive classification model that can provide insights into which customers (based on their traits) are at higher risk of churning. Answering this question has important practical managerial implications for telecommunication companies because it is a crucial step in understanding how to reduce this risk and thus create higher customer lifetime value. Further, this predictive tool will be considered a contribution to the modern telecommunication customer relationship management systems.

# Methods

## Data
The dataset we are using comes from the public IBM github page, and is made available as part of an effort (by IBM) to teach the public how to use some of their machine learning tools. Unfortunately no mention is made of exactly how the data was collected, or who was responsible for the collection. Here is a link to the [mini-course](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/predict-customer-churn-using-watson-studio-and-jupyter-notebooks/) that references the dataset we are using. The raw data is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d/master/data/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv), and lives inside the data folder of the [public repository](https://github.com/IBM/telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d) for the mini-course. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a single customer. There are 19 feature columns, along with the target column, “churn”. 

## Analysis
We used the  k-nearest neighbors (k-nn) algorithm to build a classification model to predict which customer features (19 in total, see in the feature columns) can lead to higher churn risk (see in the churn column). We used the Python language[@Python] and the following Python packages were used to perform this analysis: docopt [@docopt], os [@Python], scikit-learn [@scikit-learn], Pandas [@reback2020pandas], Numpy Array[@2020NumPy-Array], matplotlib [@hunter2007matplotlib]and altair [@vanderplas2018altair]. We used the R language[@python] and the following Python packages were used to perform this analysis: knitr [@knitr], tidyverse [@tidyverse]. Our code for the analysis and our related resources and progress reports can be found here: (https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Telco_Customer_Churn_Prediction_Group12)


# Results & Discussion
To begin, we will split the data into train and test sets (80% train/20% test). We will then carry out preliminary EDA on the training data. Specifically, we need to understand whether class imbalance will be an issue in our analysis. Therefore, we will present a table that shows the two class counts. For each of our categorical/binary features, distributions across our two classes will be plotted as stacked bar charts. For each of our numeric features, distributions across our two classes will be plotted as stacked density charts.

We will perform hyperparameter optimization, and then fit the best model on our train data before evaluating the model on our test set. At this point we will assess our final model performance using some combination of recall, precision, roc auc, and average precision. We will present a confusion matrix corresponding to our test results as a table in the final report. Finally, we will present a table showing the features most positively correlated with a high churn risk.
